        <h1>The Beauty of Nebulae</h1>
        <p>Nebulae are the nurseries of stars. These vast clouds of dust and gas exist in the interstellar medium and
            serve as the building blocks of stars and planets. The intricate patterns and colors of nebulae, like the
            famous Eagle Nebula or Orion Nebula, result from the interplay of light emitted by nearby stars with the
            dust and gases that form these cosmic clouds.</p>
        <p>Nebulae are classified into several types based on their characteristics and formation. Emission nebulae,
            for instance, are formed by ionized gases that emit light of various colors, whereas reflection nebulae
            scatter light from nearby stars. Their study has helped scientists understand the processes of star
            formation and the lifecycle of stars.</p>
